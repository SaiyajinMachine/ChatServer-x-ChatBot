Solo Project: Code for All_Bootcamp @ Porto

//The Idea
• Developed a server-based Java program that combines a chat server with a chat bot capable of playing rock-paper-scissors with the clients.

//Development Process
• Initial Planning: Designed the overall architecture focusing on client-server communication and chat bot integration. Prioritized key functionalities such as messaging and game interactions.
• Implementation: Independently developed the chat server to handle multiple client connections and created the chat bot to engage in rock-paper-scissors games with the clients.
• Integration: Combined the chat server and chat bot components, ensuring smooth communication and interactive gameplay experience for the clients.

//Key Features
• Chat Server: Supports real-time text-based communication between multiple clients.
• Chat Bot: Engages clients in rock-paper-scissors games, adding an interactive element to the chat experience.

//Tech & Methodologies
• Languages & Paradigms: Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
• Libraries & Tools: IO Network, SimpleGFX Library, IntelliJ IDEA
• Version Control: Git
